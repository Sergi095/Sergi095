## Projects

### [hoeZegJijIetsmet](https://hoezegjijietsmet.nl/)
Psychology Study at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

This project was developed while I was working as a software developer and student assistant at the psychology faculty of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

It has two versions:

- **Version 1**: Built with JATOS and pure JavaScript, used as a demo on 23rd February 2024 at NEMO Science Museum. [Repo Link](https://github.com/Sergi095/hoeZegJijIetsmet.git)
- **Version 2**: Currently under development, uses React and TypeScript, and will be hosted as an online experiment for one year.

### [Robotics Thesis: Sensory Heterogeneous Predator Swarm vs Fully Sensing Prey Swarm](https://sergi095.pythonanywhere.com/0)
Swarm predators chase swarm prey with minimal information possible.

The presentation of the thesis was made with Dash and is available online.
